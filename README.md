# Barikoi
I fully completed task 1 and task 2 but in task 3 my program output is not showing anything. Although, I tried to solve this problem by following the Barikoi website and other Google documentation.
In task 3,
I added a marker and infowindow for a specific location for the test purpose I also showed this with a function called showMarkerAndInfowindow(mapboxMap), but my code is not showing any output. So to see this test function output you have to comment out the conditions which is below of this function. But I am trying to do code for getting the current location and also trying to use Barikoi nearby API but my output is not showing anything. There is no error showing in my code.
